## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-21 (Milestone Release)

### Security & Privacy
- **Multi-Tenant Sync Isolation**: Created `database.rules.json` enforcing strict Firebase Realtime Database isolation rules. Disallowed root dumps (`.read: false`, `.write: false` at `/`), restricting clients to authenticated/scoped `$syncKey` namespaces (`/users/{syncKey}/data.json`).
- **Automatic Sync Key Provisioning**: Ensured every new extension install automatically generates a unique 32-bit cryptographically random key (`BBS-XXXXXX`), preventing any student from falling back to or writing into a shared global bucket.
- **Sliding-Window Rate Limiting**: Added in-memory sliding-window rate limiters across `api/sync.js`, Cloudflare Pages worker (`mobile-web/_worker.js`), and Node server (`self-hosted/server/server.js`), rejecting abusive traffic with standard HTTP 429 Too Many Requests.
- **Minimum Privilege Extension Permissions**: Removed `file:///*` matches and unnecessary `"downloads"` permission from `public/manifest.json`. Replaced with standard in-tab browser downloads.
- **Repository Privacy & Course Anonymization**: Removed proprietary course syllabus PDFs from `docs/syllabus/`. Anonymized default course schedules to generic `Course Faculty` and campus room references.

### Design System & Two-Tone Theme
- **Swiss Grid Universal 0px Radius**: Implemented universal `*, *::before, *::after { border-radius: 0 !important; }` across `src/popup/popup.css` and `mobile-web/styles.css`, establishing a razor-sharp, geometric, flat Swiss Grid design system.
- **Monochrome Neutral Two-Tone Theme**: Replaced legacy neon green accents (`#10b981`, `#34d399`, `#059669`) across urgency badges, completion chips, syllabus progress bars, and device pairing indicators with clean, high-contrast monochrome tokens (`#18181b` light, `#f4f4f6` dark).
- **Typography Standardization**: Eliminated all em-dashes (`—`) in user-facing UI text, buttons, and documentation in favor of standard hyphens (`-`).

### Scraper & Runtime Resilience
- **Scoped Stream Queries**: Replaced expensive `querySelectorAll('*')` DOM traversals in `scrapeUltraStreamDueItems` with scoped container selectors (`[role="feed"] *`, `.stream-item-container *`), dramatically accelerating timeline parsing.
- **Extension Context Invalidation Recovery**: Hardened content script against Manifest V3 extension reloads (`Extension context invalidated`). The floating scan pill now safely transitions state, disconnects orphaned observers, and prompts users with `"Extension updated - reload tab (F5)"`.
- **Heuristic Layout Fallback**: Added Strategy 3 fallback selectors in `scrapeAnnouncements` to handle custom web-components or future Blackboard DOM structure updates.

### Code Hygiene & Testing
- **Automated Hygiene Script**: Added `scripts/lint-check.js` (`npm run lint`, `npm run check`) verifying TypeScript compilation, Swiss Grid rules, two-tone color compliance, JSON validity, typography standards, and universal 4-way version synchronization.
- **Universal Multi-Component Synchronization**: Automated build synchronization in `scripts/build.js` ensuring the Chrome Extension, Companion PWA, Landing Page, and GitHub README stay in byte-level lockstep across every release.
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 34 test suites and 322 tests verifying sync key isolation, course matching, syllabus weights, ICS feeds, bidirectional updates, popup accessibility, and context invalidation fallbacks.

### UI & Layout Polishing
- **Fixed Extension Popup Dimensions**: Permanently locked toolbar popup at 480px by 600px, eliminating dynamic jumping and shrink-to-fit sizing on high-DPI screens while preserving responsive full-screen behavior in standalone windows.
- **Companion Header Synchronization Banner**: Resolved text truncation on the mobile web companion header; sync status now displays `Updated [Date], [Time] · [X] deadlines` with multi-line word wrap and flexible brand header sizing.
